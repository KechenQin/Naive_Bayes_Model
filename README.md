# Naive_Bayes_Model

This is a simple implementation of Bernoulli Naive Bayes model. 
The training data are blogs. The features are bag of words and the label is gender.

<b>This is my first python program and aslo my first implementation of a statistical model! Thus, you may find many irregular syntax and errors.
I post it here just for commemorating my first python program.</b>
